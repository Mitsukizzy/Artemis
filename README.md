Artemis is an Amazon Alexa experience that changes the way you engage in fitness and meal tracking. Log your food, caloric intake, and know what the breakdown of your daily diet is with a simple command. All you have to do is tell Artemis that you ate something, and she'll automatically record it for you, retrieve all pertinent nutrition information, and see how it stacks up with your daily goals. Check how you're doing at anytime by asking Artemis, "How am I doing?" or looking up your stats presented in a clear and digestible way at http://artemisalexa.com
